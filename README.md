# Diamond Drawer
A simple console-based C++ program that draws a centered diamond shape made of stars (`*`). Beginner project for practicing loops, conditionals, and output formatting.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- The user enters a number (height of the diamond).
- The program prints a symmetrical diamond made of asterisks.
- Works for both even and odd numbers.
